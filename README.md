Machine learning methods for identifing investment factors

There are now hundreds of different signals in the literature for predicting the return of a stock. These have been tested extensively, especially in regression models. The goal of this master thesis is to present a:
- comparative analysis of different machine learning methods for the problem of empirical valuation of stock prices. 
- In doing so, an extensive database is used to show that these methods outperform leading regression-based strategies from the literature in some cases. 
- Furthermore, the best method will be identified and it will be explained how the high predictive power is achieved. 
- Furthermore, it will be shown which variables are most important for the prediction.
